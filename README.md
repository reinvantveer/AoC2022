# AoC2022
My take on the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022): 
[Symantec THINK Pascal 4.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/1758-symantec-think-pascal-4-0) written on a Mac SE.

## Why?
Because I love my 1988 [Mac SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE) 1/20. It's upgraded to its max of 4 Mb of working memory and it has been retrofitted with a BlueSCSI SD card, but this component isn't required for its purpose as a AoC dev machine. It _did_ help in transferring the Symantec THINK Pascal 4.0 binaries, though.

As a retrocomputing enthusiast and having participated in previous years of AoC, I wanted to try my hand at doing AoC 2022 using one of my vintage machines. I chose the Mac SE for its usability and simply because it's as cute as a button. Just look at it!
